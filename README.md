# Image Encryption and Decryption using Central Dogma with Chaotic System

## Overview

The project involves encrypting and decrypting images using the central dogma of molecular biology as an encryption key generator. Chaotic systems are utilized to enhance the security of the encryption process, providing robust protection for sensitive image data. This combination of biological principles and chaotic dynamics offers a novel approach to image security.
