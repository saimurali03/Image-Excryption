## Abstract
A large number of images are generated and distributed in various fields every day. To protect the
image information from being stolen during the network transmission, this paper proposes a
multiple-image encryption algorithm based on genetic central dogma and three-dimensional (3D) bit
planes. This paper simulates the genetic central dogma and defines the 3D bit planes. Firstly, k original
images are transformed into 8-bit binary and converted into a 3D matrix; secondly, the 3D matrix is
permutated by rotating the bit plane and performing permutation among the bit planes; thirdly, we
encode the scrambled 3D matrix into DNA codes. The diffusion is realized by imitating the genetic
central dogma and introducing RNA mutations; finally, the encrypted images are obtained by the
RNA decoding operation. Experimental results and algorithm analyses indicate that the proposed
algorithm has strong security and desirable performance.

## Overview

The project involves encrypting and decrypting images using the central dogma of molecular biology as an encryption key generator. Chaotic systems are utilized to enhance the security of the encryption process, providing robust protection for sensitive image data. This combination of biological principles and chaotic dynamics offers a novel approach to image security.

 ## Conclusion
To improve security and encryption efficiency, this paper proposes an MIE algorithm based on genetic central
dogma and 3D bit planes, which is related to the plain images. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm is based on
the complexity of the genetic central dogma and 3D bit planes, so our algorithm is very secure in theory.
Experimental results and algorithm analyses demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is efficient and
sufficiently secure against most common attacks, such as the brute-force attack and statistical analysis attack.
Therefore, our algorithm is meant to be an excellent candidate to ensure the network security of multiple images
in the fields of military, medical, educational, etc. The precision of data can affect the quality of chaotic
sequences, even the algorithm performance. We will pay more attention to the chaotic degradation problem in
the future. Meanwhile, we will further optimize our algorithm and improve the speed through hardware.
